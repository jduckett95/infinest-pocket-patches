Analogue Pocket IPS Patches by infinest

## Credit

A huge thanks goes out to **infinest** for creating these patches. They were originally shared in the Classic Gaming Discord server and are re-hosted here with permission.

## How to use

You will need IPS patching software, the IPS patch for your chosen game and the specific ROM revision for the patch. Once the IPS patch is applied you need to change the file extension from `.gb` to `.pocket` and place them in a `GB Studio` folder on the root of your microSD card.

Please note that link cable functionality and the real-time clock are not supported in GB Studio mode.
