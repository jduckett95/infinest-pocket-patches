Analogue Pocket IPS Patches by infinest

## Credit

A huge thanks goes out to **infinest** for creating these patches. They were originally shared in the Classic Gaming Discord server and are re-hosted here with permission.

## How to use

You will need IPS patching software, the IPS patch for your chosen game and the specific ROM revision for the patch. Once the IPS patch is applied you need to change the file extension from `.gb` to `.pocket` and place them in a `GB Studio` folder on the root of your microSD card.

Please note that link cable functionality and the real-time clock are not supported in GB Studio mode.

### Kirby Tilt n Tumble

Requires the USA ROM.

This patch completely removes the accelerometer from the game an replaces it with the Game Boy Colors traditional controls.
Moving or "Tilting" has been assigned to the D-Pad, the camera can now be moved by holding Select and using the D-Pad.
Popping the floor up and jumping is done by pressing the A button while on the ground. When flying the floor can be popped up by pressing B
and you shoot by pressing A as before. Most other actions have been relegated to the B button because of a lack of buttons.
The mini games have also all been updated to support traditional controls. None of the tutorial screens have been edited though,
so you'll just have to give it a try.

The game has also been converted from MBC7 to MBC5 with traditional SRAM for saving.
This allows booting the game on any flash cart that supports MBC5.

Other than that, the one incorrectly flipped tile in the level select screen has been fixed and the options for the accelerometer were removed
from the options screen.
